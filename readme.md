Objective:
Your task is to train a Language Model (LLM) from scratch using the text of a provided book.  Your model should generate text that captures the style and thematic elements of the source material.

Requirements:
Data Preprocessing:
Download the text of the book provided in the link https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/2600/pg2600.txt.
Prepare data
Choose an appropriate model architecture for the LLM. 
Implement the model using a deep learning framework of your choice (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
Train the model.
Evaluate the model’s performance using suitable metrics.
Implement a function to generate text from a prompt that demonstrates the model's ability to mimic the style and content of the book.
